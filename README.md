# An-Empirical-Study-on-Neural-Networks-and-Portfolio-Models
This project employ LSTM to learn expected returns μ from historical prices, and input the predictions into a quadratic programming (QP) mean-variance optimizer. The study will evaluate the end-to-end return and stability of the "prediction → optimization" two-stage framework.
